when adding validation you get a error that id is needed in validation summary : 
to avoid this we add a new thing in the controller like this eg: 
customer = new customer()

this will force a value for the customer

then you add @Html.HiddenFor(c => c.customer.id); 

but this will create default values for the form like 0 for integers/doubles and 
default dates like 1 jan 2000 . 

so we take out the new thing from the controller and add the hidden helper method 
instead of the hiddenfor :  eg :

@Html.Hidden("customer.id",( Model.customer != null) ? Model.customer.id : 0 )

This will remove the default values or you can use another method because this above method 
has a magic string which is needed to be manually changed if the value is changed : 
you use a pure view model to do this . section 5 validation -code review video
